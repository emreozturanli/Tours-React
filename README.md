<hr>

## This is my first project with <b>REACT</b>
### I learned how to use;
  - <b>Components</b>
  - import/export,
  - <b>Props</b>,
  - <b>useState</b>,
  - <b>useEffect</b>,
  - Fecthing data with useEffect,
  - Conditional rendering,
  - <b>events</b> with React,
  - React <b>Developer Tool</b>,
  - Destructuring props,
  - array <b>map</b> and <b>filter</b> methods,

### Functionalities
  * Loading page appears while fetching data from API,
  * If response status is 200 then homepage displays,
  * Tours can be deleted when user click not interested button,
  * User can read more about the tour by clicking read more or can see less by clicking show less button,
  * If there is not any tours left, then user can refresh the page by clicking refresh button.
